# Optimizing a Defold game
It is important to understand the technical constraints of your target platforms and to design, implement and optimize your game to meet these requirements. For most platforms there are several aspects to consider:

* [Game size](/manuals/optimization-size) - What is the maximum acceptable size of the game bundle and how can you make the game as small as possible without compromising on quality?
* [Runtime speed](/manuals/optimization-speed) - What is the performance of the target platform and how can you make the game run with a stable frame rate at minimal CPU and/or GPU usage?
* [Memory usage](/manuals/optimization-memory) - What are the memory constraints of the target platform and how can you reduce memory usage?
* [Battery usage](/manuals/optimization-battery) - This is mainly a focus area if you are targeting mobile/handheld devices.
