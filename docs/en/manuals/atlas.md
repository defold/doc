# Atlas

While single images are often used as source for sprites, for performance reasons, images need to be combined into larger sets of images, called atlases. Combining sets of smaller images into atlases is especially important on mobile devices where memory and processing power is more scarce than on desktop machines or dedicated game consoles.

In Defold, an atlas resource is a list of separate images files, which are automatically combined into a larger image.

## Creating an Atlas

Select <kbd>New... ▸ Atlas</kbd> from the context menu in the *Assets* browser. Name the new atlas file. The editor will now open the file in the atlas editor. The atlas properties are shown in the
*Properties* pane so you can edit them (see below for details).

You need to populate an atlas with images or animations before you can use it as a graphics source for object components like Sprites and ParticleFX components.

Make sure that you have added your images to the project (drag and drop image files to the right location in the *Assets* browser)

Adding single images
: <kbd>Right click</kbd> the root Atlas entry in the *Outline* pane.

  Select <kbd>Add Images</kbd> from the pop up context menu to add single images.

  A dialog opens from which you can find and select the images you want to add to the Atlas. Note that you can filter the image files and select multiple files at once.

  ![Creating an atlas, adding images](images/atlas/add.png){srcset="images/atlas/add@2x.png 2x"}

  The added images are listed in the *Outline* and the full atlas can be seen in the center editor view. You may need to press <kbd>F</kbd> (<kbd>View ▸ Frame Selection</kbd> from the menu) to reframe the selection.

  ![Images added](images/atlas/single_images.png){srcset="images/atlas/single_images@2x.png 2x"}

Adding flipbook animations
: <kbd>Right click</kbd> the root Atlas entry in the *Outline* pane.

  Select <kbd>Add Animation Group</kbd> from the pop up context menu to create a flipbook animation group.

  A new, empty, animation group with a default name ("New Animation") is added to the atlas.

  <kbd>Right click</kbd> then new group and select <kbd>Add Images</kbd> from the context menu.

  A dialog opens from which you can find and select the images you want to add to the animation group.

  ![Creating an atlas, adding images](images/atlas/add_animation.png){srcset="images/atlas/add_animation@2x.png 2x"}

  Press <kbd>Space</kbd> with the animation group selected to preview it, and <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd+T</kbd> to close the preview. Adjust the *Properties* for the animation as needed (see below).

  ![Animation group](images/atlas/animation_group.png){srcset="images/atlas/animation_group@2x.png 2x"}

You can reorder the images in the Outline by selecting them and pressing <kbd>Alt + Up/down</kbd>. You can also easily create duplicates by copying and pasting images in the outline (From the <kbd>Edit</kbd> menu, the right click context menu or keyboard shortcuts).

## Atlas properties

Each atlas resource has a set of properties. These are shown in the *Properties* pane when you select the root item in the *Outline* view.

Size
: Shows the computed total size of the resulting texture resource. The width and height are set to the closest power of two. Note that if you enable texture compression, some formats require square textures. Non square textures will then be resized and filled with empty space to make the texture square. See the [Texture profiles manual](/manuals/texture-profiles/) for details.

Margin
: The number of pixels that should be added between each image.

Inner Padding
: The number of empty pixels that should be padded around each image.

Extrude Borders
: The number of edge pixels that should be repeatedly padded around each image. When the fragment shader samples pixels at the edge of an image, pixels of a neighbor image (on the same atlas texture) may bleed over. Extruding the border solves this problem.

Max Page Size
: The maximum size of a page in a multi-page atlas. This can be used to split an atlas into multiple pages of the same atlas to restrict atlas size while still only using a single draw call. This feature must be used in combination with multi-page atlas enabled materials found in `/builtins/materials/*_paged_atlas.material`.

![Multi-page atlas](images/atlas/multipage_atlas.png)

Rename Patterns
: A comma (´,´) separated list of search-and-replace patterns, where each pattern is of the form `search=replace`.
Each image's original name (the file base name) will be transformed using these patterns. (E.g. a pattern of `hat=cat,_normal=`, will rename an image of name `hat_normal` to `cat`). This is useful when matching animations between atlases.

Here are examples of the different property settings with four square images of size 64x64 added to an atlas. Notice how the atlas jumps to 256x256 as soon as the images won't fit 128x128, resulting in much wasted texture space.

## Image properties

Each image in an atlas has a set of properties:

Id
: The id of the image (read-only).

Size
: The width and height of the image (read-only).

Sprite Trim Mode
: How the sprite is rendered. The default is to render the sprite as a rectangle (Sprite Trim Mode set to Off). If the sprite contains a lot of transparent pixels it may be more efficient to render the sprite as a non rectangular shape using between 4 and 8 vertices. Note that sprite trimming does not work together with slice-9 sprites.

Image
: Path to the image itself.

![Image properties](images/atlas/image_properties.png){srcset="images/atlas/image_properties@2x.png 2x"}

## Animation properties

In addition to the list of images that are part of an animation group, a set of properties are available:

Id
: The name of the animation.

Fps
: The playback speed of the animation, expressed in frames per second (FPS).

Flip horizontal
: Flips the animation horizontally.

Flip vertical
: Flips the animation vertically.

Playback
: Specifies how the animation should play:

  - `None` does not play back at all, the first image is displayed.
  - `Once Forward` plays the animation one time from the first to the last image.
  - `Once Backward` plays the animation one time from the last to the first image.
  - `Once Ping Pong` plays the animation one time from the first to the last image and then back to the first image.
  - `Loop Forward` plays the animation repeatedly from the first to the last image.
  - `Loop Backward` plays the animation repeatedly from the last to the first image.
  - `Loop Ping Pong` plays the animation repeatedly from the first to the last image and then back to the first image.

## Runtime Texture and Atlas creation

Starting from Defold 1.4.2 it is possible to create a texture and an atlas at runtime.

### Creating a Texture resource at runtime

Use [`resource.create_texture(path, params)`](https://defold.com/ref/stable/resource/#resource.create_texture:path-table) to create a new texture resource:

```lua
  local params = {
    width  = 128,
    height = 128,
    type   = resource.TEXTURE_TYPE_2D,
    format = resource.TEXTURE_FORMAT_RGBA,
  }
  local my_texture_id = resource.create_texture("/my_custom_texture.texturec", params)
```

Once the texture has been created you can use [`resource.set_texture(path, params, buffer)`](https://defold.com/ref/stable/resource/#resource.set_texture:path-table-buffer) to set the pixels of the texture:

```lua
  local width = 128
  local height = 128
  local buf = buffer.create(width * height, { { name=hash("rgba"), type=buffer.VALUE_TYPE_UINT8, count=4 } } )
  local stream = buffer.get_stream(buf, hash("rgba"))

  for y=1, height do
      for x=1, width do
          local index = (y-1) * width * 4 + (x-1) * 4 + 1
          stream[index + 0] = 0xff
          stream[index + 1] = 0x80
          stream[index + 2] = 0x10
          stream[index + 3] = 0xFF
      end
  end

  local params = { width=width, height=height, x=0, y=0, type=resource.TEXTURE_TYPE_2D, format=resource.TEXTURE_FORMAT_RGBA, num_mip_maps=1 }
  resource.set_texture(my_texture_id, params, buf)
```

::: sidenote
It is possible to use `resource.set_texture()` to also update a sub-region of the texture by using a buffer width and height less than the full size of the texture and by changing the x and y parameters to `resource.set_texture()`.
:::

The texture can be used directly on a [model component](/manuals/model/) using `go.set()`:

```lua
  go.set("#model", "texture0", my_texture_id)
```

### Creating an Atlas at runtime

If the texture should be used on a [sprite component](/manuals/sprite/) it first needs to be used by an atlas. Use [`resource.create_atlas(path, params)`](https://defold.com/ref/stable/resource/#resource.create_atlas:path-table) to create an Atlas:

```lua
  local params = {
    texture = texture_id,
    animations = {
      {
        id          = "my_animation",
        width       = width,
        height      = height,
        frame_start = 1,
        frame_end   = 2,
      }
    },
    geometries = {
      {
        vertices  = {
          0,     0,
          0,     height,
          width, height,
          width, 0
        },
        uvs = {
          0,     0,
          0,     height,
          width, height,
          width, 0
        },
        indices = {0,1,2,0,2,3}
      }
    }
  }
  local my_atlas_id = resource.create_atlas("/my_atlas.texturesetc", params)

  -- assign the atlas to the 'sprite' component on the same go
  go.set("#sprite", "image", my_atlas_id)

  -- play the "animation"
  sprite.play_flipbook("#sprite", "my_animation")

```
