title: Defold project settings
brief: This manual describes how project specific settings work in Defold.
---

# Project settings

The file *game.project* contains all project wide settings. It must stay in the root folder of the project and must be named *game.project*. The first thing the engine does when starting up and launching your game is look for this file.

Every setting in the file belongs to a category. When you open the file Defold presents all settings grouped by category.

![Project settings](images/project-settings/settings.jpg)

Below are all the available settings, arranged by section. Some settings are not yet exposed in the settings editor (these are marked "hidden setting" below), but can be set manually by right clicking *game.project* and selecting <kbd>Open With â–¸ Text Editor</kbd>.

## Sections and settings

### Project

#### Title
The title of the application.

#### Version
The version of the application.

#### Write Log
When checked, the engine will write a log file *log.txt* in the project root. When running on iOS, the log file can be accessed through iTunes and the *Apps* tab and the *File Sharing* section. On Android, the file is stored in the app's external storage. When running the *dmengine* development app, you can view the log with:

```bash
$ adb shell cat /mnt/sdcard/Android/data/com.defold.dmengine/files/log.txt
```

#### Compress Archive
Enables compression of archives when bundling. Note that this currently applies to all platforms except Android where the apk already contains all data compressed.

#### Dependencies
A list of URLs to the project *Library URL*s. Refer to the [Libraries manual](/manuals/libraries/) for more information.

#### Custom Resources
`custom_resources`
A comma separated list of resources that will be included in the project. If directories are specified, all files and directories in that directory are recursively included. The resources can be loaded using [`sys.load_resource()`](/ref/sys/#sys.load_resource). Loading custom resources is covered in more detail in the [File Access manual](/manuals/file-access/#how-to-access-files-bundled-with-the-application).

#### Bundle Resources
`bundle_resources`
A comma separated list of directories containing resource files and folders that should be copied as-is into the resulting package when bundling. The directories must be specified with an absolute path from the project root, for example `/res`. The resource directory must contain subfolders named by `platform`, or `architecture-platform`.

Supported platforms are `ios`, `android`, `osx`, `win32`, `linux`, `web`, `switch`

A subfolder named `common` is also allowed, containing resource files common for all platforms.

Access to files within the the bundle resources is platform specific. The Lua module `io` is one way to do it. Care must be taken to have the correct file paths for the platform.
(e.g. prefix using "file:///android_asset/" on Android). Loading files is covered in more detail in the [File Access manual](/manuals/file-access/#how-to-access-files-bundled-with-the-application).

#### Bundle Exclude Resources
`bundle_exclude_resources`
A comma separated list of resources that should not be included in the bundle.
That is, they're removed from the result of the collection of the `bundle_resources` step.

---

### Bootstrap

#### Main Collection
File reference of the collection to use for starting the application, `/logic/main.collection` by default.

#### Render
Which render setup file to use, which defines the render pipeline, `/builtins/render/default.render` by default.

---

### Library

#### Include Dirs
A space separated list of directories that should be shared from your project via library sharing. Refer to the [Libraries manual](/manuals/libraries/) for more information.

---

### Script

#### Shared State
Check to share a single Lua state between all script types, unchecked by default.

---

### Engine

#### Run While Iconified
Allow the engine to continue running while the application window is iconified (desktop platforms only), `false` by default.

#### Fixed Update Frequency
The update frequency of the `fixed_update(self, dt)` lifecycle function. In Hertz. 60 by default.

---

### Display

#### Width
The width in pixels of the application window, `960` by default.

#### Height
The height in pixels of the application window, `640` by default.

#### High Dpi
Creates a high dpi back buffer on displays that support it. Typically the game will render in double the resolution than what is set in the *Width* and *Height* settings, which will still be the logical resolution used in scripts and properties.

#### Samples
How many samples to use for super sampling anti-aliasing. It sets the GLFW_FSAA_SAMPLES window hint. It is `0` by default, which means that anti-aliasing is turned off.

#### Fullscreen
Check if the application should start full screen. If unchecked, the application runs windowed.

#### Update Frequency
The desired frame rate in Hertz. Set to 0 for variable frame rate. A value larger than 0 will result in a fixed frame rate capped at runtime towards the actual frame rate (which means that you cannot update the game loop twice in an engine frame). Use [`sys.set_update_frequency(hz)`](https://defold.com/ref/stable/sys/?q=set_update_frequency#sys.set_update_frequency:frequency) to change this value at runtime.
 
#### Swap interval
An integer setting that sets the [OpenGL swap interval](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Swap_Interval). Does not work with Vulkan. 0 disables vsync. Default is 1.

#### Display Profiles
Specifies which display profiles file to use, `/builtins/render/default.display_profilesc` by default. Learn more in the [GUI Layouts manual](/manuals/gui-layouts/#creating-display-profiles).

#### Dynamic Orientation
Check if the app should dynamically switch between portrait and landscape on device rotation. Note that the development app does not currently respect this setting.

---

### Render

#### Clear Color Red
Clear color red channel, used by the render script and when the window is created.

#### Clear Color Green
Clear color green channel, used by the render script and when the window is created.

#### Clear Color Blue
Clear color blue channel, used by the render script and when the window is created.

#### Clear Color Alpha
Clear color alpha channel, used by the render script and when the window is created.

#### Scale
Tells the physics engine how to scale the physics worlds in relation to the game world for numerical precision, `0.01`--`1.0`. If the value is set to `0.02`, it means that the physics engine will view 50 units as 1 meter ($1 / 0.02$). The default value is `1.0`.

#### Allow Dynamic Transforms
Check if the physics engine should apply the transform of a game object to any attached collision object components. This can be used to move, scale and rotate collision shapes, even those that are dynamic. `true` by default.

#### Use Fixed Timestep
Check if the physics engine should use fixed and framerate independent updates. Use this setting in combination with the `fixed_update(self, dt)` lifecycle function and the `engine.fixed_update_frequency` project setting to interact with the physics engine at regular intervals. For new projects the recommended setting is `true`. `false` by default

#### Debug Scale

## File format

The format of the settings file is simple text (INI format) and can be edited by any standard text editor. The format looks like this:

```ini
[category1]
setting1 = value
setting2 = value
[category2]
...
```

A real example is:

```ini
[bootstrap]
main_collection = /main/main.collectionc
```

which means that the setting *main_collection* belongs to the *bootstrap* category.
Whenever a file reference is used, like the example above, the path needs to be appended with a 'c' character, which means you're referencing the compiled version of the file.
Also note that the folder containing *game.project* will be the project root, which is why there is an initial '/' in the setting path.


## Setting config values on engine startup

When the engine starts, it is possible to provide config values from the command line that override the *game.project* settings:

```bash
# Specify a bootstrap collection
$ dmengine --config=bootstrap.main_collection=/my.collectionc

# Set two custom config values
$ dmengine --config=test.my_value=4711 --config=test2.my_value2=1234
```

Custom values can---just like any other config value---be read with [`sys.get_config()`](/ref/sys/#sys.get_config):

```lua
local my_value = tonumber(sys.get_config("test.my_value"))
```


:[Component max count optimizations](../shared/component-max-count-optimizations.md)


## Custom project settings

It is possible to define custom settings for the main project or for a [native extension](/manuals/extensions/). Custom settings for the main project must be defined in a `game.properties` file in the root of the project. For a native extension they should be defined in an `ext.properties` file next to the `ext.manifest` file.

The settings file uses the same INI format as *game.project* and property attributes are defined using a dot notation with a suffix:

```
[my_category]
my_property.private = 1
...
```

The default meta file that is always applied is available [here](https://github.com/defold/defold/blob/dev/com.dynamo.cr/com.dynamo.cr.bob/src/com/dynamo/bob/meta.properties)

The following attributes are currently available:

```
// `type` - used for the value string parsing (only in bob.jar for now)
my_property.type = string // one of the following values: bool, string, number, integer, string_array, resource

// `help` - used as help tip in the editor (not used for now)
my_property.help = string

// `default` - value used as default if user didn't set value manually (only in bob.jar for now)
my_property.default = string

// `private` - private value used during the bundle process but will be removed from the bundle itself
my_property.private = 1 // boolean value 1 or 0

``` 


At the moment meta properties are used only in `bob.jar` when bundling application, but later will be parsed by the editor and represented in the *game.project* viewer.
