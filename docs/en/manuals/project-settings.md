title: Defold project settings
brief: This manual describes how project specific settings work in Defold.
---

# Project settings

The file *game.project* contains all project wide settings. It must stay in the root folder of the project and must be named *game.project*. The first thing the engine does when starting up and launching your game is look for this file.

Every setting in the file belongs to a category. When you open the file Defold presents all settings grouped by category.

![Project settings](images/project-settings/settings.jpg)

Below are all the available settings, arranged by section. Some settings are not yet exposed in the settings editor (these are marked "hidden setting" below), but can be set manually by right clicking "game.project" and selecting <kbd>Open With â–¸ Text Editor</kbd>.

## Project

#### Title
The title of the application.

#### Version
The version of the application.

#### Write Log
When checked, the engine will write a log file *log.txt* in the project root. When running on iOS, the log file can be accessed through iTunes and the *Apps* tab and the *File Sharing* section. On Android, the file is stored in the app's external storage. When running the *dmengine* development app, you can view the log with:

```bash
$ adb shell cat /mnt/sdcard/Android/data/com.defold.dmengine/files/log.txt
```

#### Compress Archive
Enables compression of archives when bundling. Note that this currently applies to all platforms except Android where the apk already contains all data compressed.

#### Dependencies
A list of URLs to the project *Library URL*s. Refer to the [Libraries manual](/manuals/libraries/) for more information.

#### Custom Resources
A comma separated list of resources that will be included in the project. If directories are specified, all files and directories in that directory are recursively included. The resources can be loaded using [`sys.load_resource()`](/ref/sys/#sys.load_resource).

#### Bundle Resources
A comma separated list of directories containing resource files and folders that should be copied as-is into the resulting package when bundling. The directories must be specified with an absolute path from the project root, for example `/res`. The resource directory must contain subfolders named by `platform`, or `architecure-platform`.

  Supported platforms are `ios`, `android`, `osx`, `win32`, `linux`, `web`.

  A subfolder named `common` is also allowed, containing resource files common for all platforms.

#### Bundle Exclude Resources
A comma separated list of resources that should not be included in the bundle.

## Bootstrap

#### Main Collection
File reference of the collection to use for starting the application, `/logic/main.collection` by default.

#### Render
Which render setup file to use, which defines the render pipeline, `/builtins/render/default.render` by default.

## Library

#### Include Dirs
A space separated list of directories that should be shared from your project via library sharing.

## Script

#### Shared State
Check to share a single Lua state between all script types, unchecked by default.

## Display

#### Width
The width in pixels of the application window, `960` by default.

#### Height
The height in pixels of the application window, `640` by default.

#### High Dpi
Creates a high dpi back buffer on displays that support it. Typically the game will render in double the resolution than what is set in the *Width* and *Height* settings, which will still be the logical resolution used in scripts and properties.

#### Samples
How many samples to use for super sampling anti-aliasing. It sets the GLFW_FSAA_SAMPLES window hint. It is `0` by default, which means that anti-aliasing is turned off.

#### Fullscreen
Check if the application should start full screen. If unchecked, the application runs windowed.

#### Frame Cap
If `Vsync` checked, snaps to the closest matching swap interval for the set frame cap if a monitor is detected. Otherwise uses timers to respect the set value, 0 means no cap. This setting maps to `display.update_frequency`.

#### Vsync
Vertical sync, rely on hardware vsync for frame timing. Can be overridden depending on graphics driver and platform specifics.

#### Variable Dt (deprecated)
Deprecated. If checked, will check `Vsync` and set `Frame Cap` to 0 at build-time for equivalent behavior.

#### Display Profiles
Specifies which display profiles file to use, `/builtins/render/default.display_profilesc` by default. Learn more in the [GUI Layouts manual](/manuals/gui-layouts/#creating-display-profiles). 

#### Dynamic Orientation
Check if the app should dynamically switch between portrait and landscape on device rotation. Note that the development app does not currently respect this setting.

#### Gravity Z
World gravity along z-axis, `0` by default.

#### Scale
Tells the physics engine how to scale the physics worlds in relation to the game world for numerical precision, `0.01`--`1.0`. If the value is set to `0.02`, it means that the physics engine will view 50 units as 1 meter ($1 / 0.02$). The default value is `1.0`.

#### Public Key
If set, use the specified public key file when bundling live update content. If no key file is set, a key is generated.

## Native extension

#### _App Manifest_
If set, use the app manifest to customize the engine build. This allows you to remove unneeded parts from the engine making it possible to decrease the final binary size. Note that this feature is in alpha state. Please visit [the forum](https://forum.defold.com/t/native-extensions/4946/142) for information on how to proceed.

## Profiler

#### Track Cpu
If checked, enable CPU profiling in release versions of the builds. Normally, you can only access profiling information in debug builds.

## File format

The format of the settings file is simple text (INI format) and can be edited by any standard text editor. The format looks like this:

```ini
[category1]
setting1 = value
setting2 = value
[category2]
...
```

A real example is:

```ini
[bootstrap]
main_collection = /main/main.collectionc
```

which means that the setting *main_collection* belongs to the *bootstrap* category.
Whenever a file reference is used, like the example above, the path needs to be appended with a 'c' character, which means you're referencing the compiled version of the file.
Also note that the folder containing *game.project* will be the project root, which is why there is an initial '/' in the setting path.

## Setting config values on engine startup

When the engine starts, it is possible to provide config values from the command line that override the *game.project* settings:

```bash
# Specify a bootstap collection
$ dmengine --config=bootstrap.main_collection=/my.collectionc

# Set two custom config values
$ dmengine --config=test.my_value=4711 --config=test2.my_value2=1234
```

Custom values can---just like any other config value---be read with [`sys.get_config()`](/ref/sys/#sys.get_config):

```lua
local my_value = tonumber(sys.get_config("test.my_value"))
```

## Vsync, frame cap, and swap interval
The first thing of note is that on desktop platforms vsync can be controlled globally by graphics card settings. If for example vsync is force-enabled in the graphics control panel it is not user controllable, e.g. the setting cannot be accessed or modified from Defold. Most mobile devices also has vsync enabled by default.

With `Vsync` checked in `game.project` the engine relies on hardware vsync and uses a fixed time step `dt` based on any detected monitor refresh rate. This is the default setting. With `Vsync` checked and `Frame cap` > 0, the rate will be clamped to a swap interval that matches any detected main monitor refresh rate. With `Vsync` unchecked and `Frame cap` 0, the time step is not fixed but instead uses actual elapsed time difference for `dt`. With `Vsync` unchecked and `Frame cap` > 0, timers are used to respect the set frame cap value. There is no guarantee that the frame cap will be achieved depending on platform specifics and hardware settings.

Swap interval is the interval with which to swap the front and back buffers in sync with vertical blanks (v-blank), the hardware event where the screen image is updated with data from the front buffer. A value of 1 swaps the buffers at every v-blank, a value of 2 swaps the buffers every other v-blank and so on. A value of 0 disables waiting for v-blank before swapping the buffers\*. Setting `swap_interval` is done by calling the [```set_vsync_swap_interval```](/ref/sys/#sys.set_vsync_swap_interval:swap_interval) function.

### Caveat
Currently, Defold queries for monitor refresh rate at init and uses that as a basis for picking a fixed `dt`. If you want to support monitors using variable refresh rate (GSync or FreeSync for example) or other scenarios where the refresh rate might not be trivial to query, uncheck `Vsync`to let the engine measure actual `dt` each frame instead of relying on a fixed time step.
