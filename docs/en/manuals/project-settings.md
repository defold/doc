title: Defold project settings
brief: This manual describes how project specific settings work in Defold.
---

# Project settings

The file *game.project* contains all project wide settings. It must stay in the root of the project and must be named *game.project*. The first thing the engine does when starting up and launching your game is looking for this file.

Every setting in the file belongs to a category. The format of the file is simple text and can be edited by any standard text editor. The format looks like this:

```ini
[category1]
setting1 = value
setting2 = value
[category2]
...
```

A real example is:

```ini
[bootstrap]
main_collection = /main/main.collectionc
```

which means that the setting *main_collection* belongs to the *bootstrap* category.
Whenever a file reference is used, like the example above, the path needs to be appended with a 'c' character, which means you're referencing the compiled version of the file.
Also note that the folder containing *game.project* will be the project root, which is why there is an initial '/' in the setting path.

Below are all the available settings, arranged by section. Some settings are not yet exposed in the settings editor (these are marked "hidden setting" below), but can be set manually by right clicking "game.project" and selecting <kbd>Open With â–¸ Text Editor</kbd>.

## Setting config values on engine startup

When the engine starts, it is possible to provide config values from the command line that override the *game.project* settings:

```bash
# Specify a bootstap collection
$ dmengine --config=bootstrap.main_collection=/my.collectionc

# Set the custom value "test.my_value"
$ dmengine --config=test.my_value=4711
```

Custom values can---just as any other config value---be read with [`sys.get_config()`](/ref/sys/#sys.get_config).

## Project

title
: The title of the application.

version
: The version of the application.

write_log
: When checked the engine will write a log file *log.txt* in the project root. When running on iOS, the log file can be accessed through iTunes and the *Apps* tab and the *File Sharing* section. On Android, the file is stored in the apps external storage. When running the *dmengine* development app, you can view the log with:

```bash
$ adb shell cat /mnt/sdcard/Android/data/com.defold.dmengine/files/log.txt
```

compress_archive
: Enables compression of archives when bundling. Note that this currently applies to all platforms except Android where the apk already contains all data compressed.

dependencies
: A comma-separated list of URL:s to the project *Library URL*:s (can be found in the [Defold dashboard](//dashboard.defold.com)) that this project uses. Note that you need to be a member of the dependent projects.

custom_resources (hidden setting)
: A comma separated list of resources that will be included in the project. If directories are specified, all files and directories in that directory are recursively included.

bundle_resources (hidden setting)
: A directory containing resource files and folders that should be copied as-is into the resulting package when bundling. The directory is specified with an absolute path from the project root, for example `/res`. The resource directory should contain subfolders named by `platform`, or `architecure-platform`. Supported platforms are `ios`, `android` and `osx`. Supported arc-platform pairs are `armv7-ios`, `arm64-ios`, `armv7-android` and `x86_64-osx`. A subfolder named `common` is also allowed, containing resource files common for all platforms.
