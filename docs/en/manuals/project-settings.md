title: Defold project settings
brief: This manual describes how project specific settings work in Defold.
---

# Project settings

The file *game.project* contains all project wide settings. It must stay in the root folder of the project and must be named *game.project*. The first thing the engine does when starting up and launching your game is look for this file.

Every setting in the file belongs to a category. When you open the file Defold presents all settings grouped by category.

![Project settings](images/project-settings/settings.jpg)

Below are all the available settings, arranged by section. Some settings are not yet exposed in the settings editor (these are marked "hidden setting" below), but can be set manually by right clicking "game.project" and selecting <kbd>Open With â–¸ Text Editor</kbd>.

## Sections and settings

### Project

#### Title
The title of the application.

#### Version
The version of the application.

#### Write Log
When checked, the engine will write a log file *log.txt* in the project root. When running on iOS, the log file can be accessed through iTunes and the *Apps* tab and the *File Sharing* section. On Android, the file is stored in the app's external storage. When running the *dmengine* development app, you can view the log with:

```bash
$ adb shell cat /mnt/sdcard/Android/data/com.defold.dmengine/files/log.txt
```

#### Compress Archive
Enables compression of archives when bundling. Note that this currently applies to all platforms except Android where the apk already contains all data compressed.

#### Dependencies
A list of URLs to the project *Library URL*s. Refer to the [Libraries manual](/manuals/libraries/) for more information.

#### Custom Resources
`custom_resources`
A comma separated list of resources that will be included in the project. If directories are specified, all files and directories in that directory are recursively included. The resources can be loaded using [`sys.load_resource()`](/ref/sys/#sys.load_resource).

#### Bundle Resources
`bundle_resources`
A comma separated list of directories containing resource files and folders that should be copied as-is into the resulting package when bundling. The directories must be specified with an absolute path from the project root, for example `/res`. The resource directory must contain subfolders named by `platform`, or `architecure-platform`.

Supported platforms are `ios`, `android`, `osx`, `win32`, `linux`, `web`, `switch`

A subfolder named `common` is also allowed, containing resource files common for all platforms.

Access to files within the the bundle resources is platform specific. The Lua module `io` is one way to do it. Care must be taken to have the correct file paths for the platform.
(e.g. prefix using "file:///android_asset/" on Android)

#### Bundle Exclude Resources
`bundle_exclude_resources`
A comma separated list of resources that should not be included in the bundle.
That is, they're removed from the result of the collection of the `bundle_resources` step.

---

### Bootstrap

#### Main Collection
File reference of the collection to use for starting the application, `/logic/main.collection` by default.

#### Render
Which render setup file to use, which defines the render pipeline, `/builtins/render/default.render` by default.

---

### Library

#### Include Dirs
A space separated list of directories that should be shared from your project via library sharing.

---

### Script

#### Shared State
Check to share a single Lua state between all script types, unchecked by default.

---

### Engine

#### Run While Iconified
Allow the engine to continue running while the application window is iconified (desktop platforms only), `false` by default.

### Display

#### Width
The width in pixels of the application window, `960` by default.

#### Height
The height in pixels of the application window, `640` by default.

#### High Dpi
Creates a high dpi back buffer on displays that support it. Typically the game will render in double the resolution than what is set in the *Width* and *Height* settings, which will still be the logical resolution used in scripts and properties.

#### Samples
How many samples to use for super sampling anti-aliasing. It sets the GLFW_FSAA_SAMPLES window hint. It is `0` by default, which means that anti-aliasing is turned off.

#### Fullscreen
Check if the application should start full screen. If unchecked, the application runs windowed.

#### Frame Cap
If `Vsync` checked, snaps to the closest matching swap interval for the set frame cap if a monitor is detected. Otherwise uses timers to respect the set value, 0 means no cap. This setting maps to `display.update_frequency`. ([See below](#vsync-frame-cap-and-swap-interval)).

#### Vsync
Vertical sync, rely on hardware vsync for frame timing. Can be overridden depending on graphics driver and platform specifics. ([See below](#vsync-frame-cap-and-swap-interval)).

#### Display Profiles
Specifies which display profiles file to use, `/builtins/render/default.display_profilesc` by default. Learn more in the [GUI Layouts manual](/manuals/gui-layouts/#creating-display-profiles).

#### Dynamic Orientation
Check if the app should dynamically switch between portrait and landscape on device rotation. Note that the development app does not currently respect this setting.

---

### Render

#### Clear Color Red
Clear color red channel, used by the render script and when the window is created.

#### Clear Color Green
Clear color green channel, used by the render script and when the window is created.

#### Clear Color Blue

---

## File format

The format of the settings file is simple text (INI format) and can be edited by any standard text editor. The format looks like this:

```ini
[category1]
setting1 = value
setting2 = value
[category2]
...
```

A real example is:

```ini
[bootstrap]
main_collection = /main/main.collectionc
```

which means that the setting *main_collection* belongs to the *bootstrap* category.
Whenever a file reference is used, like the example above, the path needs to be appended with a 'c' character, which means you're referencing the compiled version of the file.
Also note that the folder containing *game.project* will be the project root, which is why there is an initial '/' in the setting path.


## Setting config values on engine startup

When the engine starts, it is possible to provide config values from the command line that override the *game.project* settings:

```bash
# Specify a bootstap collection
$ dmengine --config=bootstrap.main_collection=/my.collectionc

# Set two custom config values
$ dmengine --config=test.my_value=4711 --config=test2.my_value2=1234
```

Custom values can---just like any other config value---be read with [`sys.get_config()`](/ref/sys/#sys.get_config):

```lua
local my_value = tonumber(sys.get_config("test.my_value"))
```


## Component max count optimizations
The `game.project` settings file contains many values specifying the maximum number of a certain resource that can exist at the same time, often counted per loaded collection (also called world). The Defold engine will use these max values to preallocate memory for this amount of memory to avoid dynamic allocations and memory fragmentation while the game is running.

The Defold data structures used to represent components and other resources are optimized to use as little memory as possible but care should still be taken when setting the values to avoid allocating more memory than is actually necessary.

To further optimize memory usage the Defold build process will analyse the content of the game and override the max counts if it is possible to know for certain the exact amount:

* If a collection doesn't contain any factory components the exact amount of each component will be allocated and the max count values will be ignored.
* If a collection contains a factory component the spawned objects will be analysed and the max count will be used for components that can be spawned from the factories.


## Vsync, frame cap, and swap interval
The first thing of note is that on desktop platforms vsync can be controlled globally by graphics card settings. If for example vsync is force-enabled in the graphics control panel it is not user controllable, e.g. the setting cannot be accessed or modified from Defold. Most mobile devices also has vsync enabled by default.

With `Vsync` checked in `game.project` the engine relies on hardware vsync and uses a fixed time step `dt` based on any detected monitor refresh rate. This is the default setting. With `Vsync` checked and `Frame cap` > 0, the rate will be clamped to a swap interval that matches any detected main monitor refresh rate. With `Vsync` unchecked and `Frame cap` 0, the time step is not fixed but instead uses actual elapsed time difference for `dt`. With `Vsync` unchecked and `Frame cap` > 0, timers are used to respect the set frame cap value. There is no guarantee that the frame cap will be achieved depending on platform specifics and hardware settings.

Swap interval is the interval with which to swap the front and back buffers in sync with vertical blanks (v-blank), the hardware event where the screen image is updated with data from the front buffer. A value of 1 swaps the buffers at every v-blank, a value of 2 swaps the buffers every other v-blank and so on. A value of 0 disables waiting for v-blank before swapping the buffers\*. Setting `swap_interval` is done by calling the [```set_vsync_swap_interval```](/ref/sys/#sys.set_vsync_swap_interval:swap_interval) function.


### Caveat
Currently, Defold queries for monitor refresh rate at init and uses that as a basis for picking a fixed `dt`. If you want to support monitors using variable refresh rate (GSync or FreeSync for example) or other scenarios where the refresh rate might not be trivial to query, uncheck `Vsync`to let the engine measure actual `dt` each frame instead of relying on a fixed time step.


### Vsync and frame cap in Defold
