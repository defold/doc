# Spine Model

The SpineModel component is used to bring _Spine_ skeletal animations to life in Defold.

## Creating SpineModel components

Select a game object to hold the new component:

Either create the component in-place (<kbd>right click</kbd> the game object and select <kbd>Add Component ▸ Spine Model</kbd>)

Or create it on file first (<kbd>right click</kbd> a location in the *Assets* browser, then select <kbd>New... ▸ Spine Model</kbd> from the context menu), then add the file to the game object by <kbd>right clicking</kbd> the game object and selecting <kbd>Add Component File</kbd>).

## Spine model properties

Apart from the properties *Id*, *Position* and *Rotation* the following component specific properties exist:

*Spine scene*
: Set this to the Spine scene file you created earlier.

*Blend Mode*
: If you want a blend mode other than the default `Alpha`, change this property.

*Material*
: If you need to render the model with a custom material, change this property.

*Default animation*
: Set this to the animation you want the model to start with.

*Skin*
: If your model has skins, select the one you want it to start with.

You should now be able to view your Spine model in the editor:

![Spine model in editor](images/spinemodel/spinemodel.png){srcset="images/spinemodel/spinemodel@2x.png 2x"}

### Blend modes
:[blend-modes](../shared/blend-modes.md)

## Runtime manipulation

You can manipulate spine models in runtime through a number of different functions and properties (refer to the [API docs for usage](/ref/spine/)).

### Runtime animation

Defold provides powerful support for controlling animation in runtime:

```lua
local play_properties = { blend_duration = 0.1 }
spine.play_anim("#spinemodel", "jump", go.PLAYBACK_ONCE_FORWARD, play_properties)
```

The animation playback cursor can be animated either by hand or through the property animation system:

```lua
-- set the run animation
spine.play_anim("#spinemodel", "run", go.PLAYBACK_NONE)
-- animate the cursor
go.animate("#spinemodel", "cursor", go.PLAYBACK_LOOP_PINGPONG, 1, go.EASING_LINEAR, 10)
```

### Changing properties

A spine model also has a number of different properties that can be manipulated using `go.get()` and `go.set()`:

`animation`
: The current model animation (`hash`) (READ ONLY). You change animation using `spine.play_anim()` (see above).

`cursor`
: The normalized animation cursor (`number`).

`material`
: The spine model material (`hash`). You can change this using a material resource property and `go.set()`. Refer to the [API reference for an example](/ref/spine/#material).

`playback_rate`
: The animation playback rate (`number`).

`skin`
: The current skin on the component (`hash`).

## Material constants

{% include shared/material-constants.md component='spine' variable='tint' %}

`tint`
: The color tint of the spine model (`vector4`). The vector4 is used to represent the tint with x, y, z, and w corresponding to the red, green, blue and alpha tint.

## Project configuration

The *game.project* file has a few [project settings](/manuals/project-settings#spine) related to spine models.
