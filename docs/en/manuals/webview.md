title: WebViews in Defold
brief: "WebViews allows you to load and display web pages as overlays in your mobile games. They can
        also run user supplied JavaScript in the background. This manual explains Defold's official
        WebView extension, API and functionality."

# WebViews
The WebView extension provides a unified API to load and display web pages as overlays on mobile
platforms. In this manual we will first go through some basic information how to create and show a webview.
Later on we will explore more functionality by implementing a simple player feedback window.

## Installing the extension

To start using the webview extension you need to add it as a dependency to your `game.project` file.
The latest stable version is available with the dependency URL:
```
https://github.com/defold/extension-webview/archive/master.zip
```

Documentation of the API is available on [extension GitHub page](https://defold.github.io/extension-webview/).

## Opening a WebView
Opening a webview is a simple call to `webview.create`, which will return an identification number
associated with the newly created webview. This ID, which we will call `webview_id` from now on,
will be used in other `webview` functions to interact with the specific webview instance. This means
you can create and maintain multiple webviews simultaneously.

The `webview.create` function takes a single argument in the form of a function, we will take a
closer look at this in the callbacks section below, for now let's just pass in an empty function.
```lua
local webview_id = webview.create(function()
        -- do nothing for now
    end)
```
Newly created webviews are hidden by default and doesn't actually load anything. But a webview isn't
much fun without anything to show, so let's load one of our favorite web pages!

To open a web page we need to call the function `webview.open` and pass along the `webview_id` we
got from the previous call and a web URL as the second argument.

```lua
local request_id = webview.open(webview_id, "http://www.defold.com")
```

The call will return a new id that can be used to keep track of the URL request, it will also be
provided in the callback which we will go into detail about below.

If everything was successful you should now see a webview covering the full screen, it will also
load the Defold official website.

::: important
To load arbitrary URL on iOS you need to add the following key-value inside the
`NSAppTransportSecurity` dictionary entry in your `Info.plist` file.
```
<key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
<true/>
```

This is a valid setting to use while developing your game, but when releasing on the App Store it
preferred to only allow specific domains by utilizing the `NSExceptionDomains` key instead. These
options are a bit outside the scope of this manual, but more detailed information can be found
in the [Apple Developer documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CocoaKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009251-SW35).

## Callback
Just opening web pages inside a webview might be sufficient in most cases, but what happens if the
URL isn't accessible or something unforeseen happens while loading? Perhaps we want to show a
notification to the user if we encounter an error, or we want to perform some action if a user
navigates away from the web page. Thankfully the webview extension has functionality to trigger
events when errors, navigations and success occur! They are exposed through the callback function we
pass as argument to the `webview.create` call.

The callback function should have the following signature:
```lua
function callback(self, webview_id, request_id, type, data)
```

* **`self`** - This is the script instance from where the callback was set.
* **`webview_id`** - The callback can be reused for multiple webview instances, this argument let's
you keep track of from which instance the event originates from.
* **`request_id`** - Likewise, you can trigger multiple `webview.open` calls, and the request id
allows you to know which of the requests the event was triggered from.
* **`type`** - An enum describing what kind of event happened, we will go through them below in
*Callback types*.
* **`data`** - A table containing different information depending on what type of event occurred.

#### Callback types
The `type` argument of the callback are always set to one of the following enums:

* **`webview.CALLBACK_RESULT_URL_LOADING`** - When a navigation occurs inside the webview, the
loading event is triggered. This can happen either if you call `webview.open` or the user clicks
on a link that would result in a new URL being loaded. The result of the callback dictates if the
navigation is allowed. If you return `false` the navigation will be blocked, any other return value
will allow the navigation. To decide if the navigation should be allowed or not, you can inspect
the `url` field in the `data` table, also supplied in the callback.
* **`webview.CALLBACK_RESULT_URL_ERROR`** and **`webview.CALLBACK_RESULT_EVAL_ERROR`** - In case of
errors loading the URL, or errors when trying to evaluate JavaScript (we will go into details below
in *Running JavaScript*), an error event will be triggered. The `result` field in the `data` table
contains more information about the error, as a string.
* **`webview.CALLBACK_RESULT_URL_OK`** and **`webview.CALLBACK_RESULT_EVAL_OK`** - When a URL
navigation or JavaScript execution was successful, an ok event will be triggered. In the case of
a successful JavaScript evaluation the result will be available in the `result` field of the `data`
table.

Now that we know a bit more of how the callback is called, let's create a more advanced example.

Imagine if we want to show some player feedback webpage, where the player can report feedback about
the game through a HTML form. We want to know if the URL couldn't be loaded, instead of an empty
page we want to show some ingame notification and close the webview. And we probably don't want the
player to be able to navigate away from the form.

Our updated `webview.create` call and callback could looks something like this:
```lua
local player_feedback_url = "https://example.com/my_game_name/customer_feedback"

local function webview_callback(self, webview_id, request_id, type, data)
    if type == webview.CALLBACK_RESULT_URL_ERROR then
        -- An error occurred!
        -- Let's close the webview and set a label with some helpful text!
        webview.destroy(webview_id)
        label.set_text("#label", "Player feedback not available at this moment.")

    elseif type == webview.CALLBACK_RESULT_URL_LOADING then
        -- Make sure the player isn't navigating away from the feedback URL.
        if data.url ~= player_feedback_url then
            return false
        end
    end
end

local feedback_webview = webview.create(webview_callback)
webview.open(feedback_webview, player_feedback_url)
```

This will result in a full screen webview being shown, loading a remote web page with our player
feedback form. Depending of how we setup our player feedback webpage it will look something like
this:

![Player feedback web page](images/webview/webview_player_feedback1.png)

Note: In our example we also included a link to google.com, just to verify that blocking any navigation
that would lead away from our webpage.

We now have our first working player feedback prototype! But what should happen once the player has
provided feedback? Maybe the player changes their mind and don't want to provide any feedback,
how do they get back to your game? Lastly, a full screen webview might not be the best option in
this case, perhaps we still want to show that the game is still running in the background! We will
cover solutions for these issues in the *Running JavaScript* and
*Visibility and positioning control* sections below.

## Opening and displaying a custom HTML page
Before we continue with handling positioning/sizing and being able to close the webview, let's make
it a bit easier to iterate on the HTML page without having to update our webserver with each change.

With `webview.open_raw` we can provide a HTML source directly instead of loading it from a remote
URL. This means that even if the webserver is down, or the player have a slow internet connection,
we can still show the feedback form.

The first argument to `webview.open_raw` is just like `webview.open`, the `webview_id`. The second
argument is a string with raw HTML source, instead of an URL as in the previous function.

Let's recreate the previous example but inline the HTML directly in our Lua source:
```lua
local feedback_html = [[
<html>
<script type="text/javascript">
    function closeWebview() {
        // TODO
    }
    function submitFeedback() {
        // do something with the feedback here
        // ...
    }
</script>
<body>
    <center>
    <h4>Hello Player!</h4>
    <p>Please provide some feedback for my awesome game!</p>
    <form>
        <label>Game feedback:<br><textarea placeholder="Is it fun? What can be improved?" style="width: 300px; height: 80px"></textarea></label><br>
        <input type="button" onclick="submitFeedback()" value="Submit feedback">
        <br>
        <input type="button" onclick="closeWebview()" value="Cancel">
    </form>
</center>
</body>
</html>
]]

local function webview_callback(self, webview_id, request_id, type, data)
    -- ...
end

local webview_id = webview.create(webview_callback)
webview.open_raw(webview_id, feedback_html)
```

This should give us a similar webview as in the previous example, with the added benefit that we
can edit the HTML directly in our game source code. **Note:** The contents of `webview_callback` has
only been removed for readability.

Since we know that the HTML source is going to grow a bit once we start adding JavaScript code and
CSS, it now makes sense to separate the HTML data into its own file and load it dynamically during
runtime using [`sys.load_resource`](https://www.defold.com/ref/sys/#sys.load_resource:filename).
This also means that we more easily can view the HTML file in a desktop browser while we are
developing.

Let's create a new directory (`custom_resources`), and a HTML file (`feedback.html`) with the data
instead and set the `feedback_html` variable dynamically instead.

```lua
local feedback_html = sys.load_resource("/custom_resources/feedback.html")
-- ...
webview.open_raw(webview_id, feedback_html)
```

## Visibility and positioning control
Now let's tackle the issue of the webview being full screen.

To get a more immersive interaction we might want the webview only cover the upper part of the
screen. We can use the `webview.set_position` function to both set the position and width of a
webview. Passing in `-1` as either width or height will make the webview take up the full space on the
corresponding axis.

```lua
local webview_id = webview.create(webview_callback)
-- Position: top left corner of screen (0, 0)
-- Size: we want full with, but only 500px height
webview.set_position(webview_id, 0, 0, -1, 500)
```

![Resized feedback page](images/webview/webview_player_feedback2.png)

If the user is on a device with poor performance, the page might not load instantly and display as
white while loading. This might be jarring to our player, so let's hide the webview until the page
has loaded. This also gives us the opportunity to show a loading indication in-game to reassure the
player that the game is actually doing something.

To hide the webview we can pass along an options table to the third argument of our
`webview.open_raw` (or `webview.open`) call, with the field `hidden` set to `true`. The default
value of this field is `false` as we have seen before, once we opened a URL or HTML the webview
was immediately visible.

```lua
webview.open_raw(webview_id, feedback_html, {hidden = true})
```

To make sure the webview successfully loaded the URL or HTML we want to wait for the callback to
trigger with an event of type `webview.CALLBACK_RESULT_URL_OK`. Once we get this we know that we can
unhide the webview, which can be accomplished with the `webview.set_visible` function.

Let's update our callback with this new logic:
```lua
local function webview_callback(self, webview_id, request_id, type, data)
    if type == webview.CALLBACK_RESULT_URL_OK then
        -- No errors, let's present the webview!
        webview.set_visible(webview_id, 1)
    elseif type == webview.CALLBACK_RESULT_URL_ERROR then
        -- ...
```

## Running JavaScript
Now we have managed to fix most of our issues, but one last thing is still unsolved; being able to
close the webview.

We have already seen and used the function that will close and remove the webview in our callback
when we encounter an error, `webview.destroy`. But we need a way from inside the webview to trigger
the function call. Thankfully we there is a way from Lua to call JavaScript that will run inside the
webview and read the result. With this we should be able to poll for changes inside the webview.

Let's start with adding some state inside the JavaScript tag of the HTML that we can change when
the buttons are pressed on the web page.
```js
var shouldClose = false;
function closeWebview() {
    shouldClose = true;
}
function submitFeedback() {
    // do something with the feedback here
    // ...
    closeWebview();
}

```

Now once the player presses either the "Submit feedback" or "Cancel" button we update the
`shouldClose` variable.

Now somewhere in our Lua script we need to check for this state and call `webview.destroy`. A naive
place would be to check for this every frame, in our `update` function.

```lua
function update(self, dt)
    if not self.closeCheckRequest then
        self.closeCheckRequest = webview.eval(webview_id, "shouldClose")
    end
end
```

It's important to note here that the result from `webview.eval` is not the result from the
JavaScript being evaluated, but a *request id*. We need to update our callback to check against this
request id, and inspect the `data.result` field, which is where the actual JavaScript result will be
stored.

```lua
local function webview_callback(self, webview_id, request_id, type, data)
    if type == webview.CALLBACK_RESULT_EVAL_OK and
        request_id == self.closeCheckRequest then

        -- Compare the JavaScript result, if it's "true" (or "1" on iOS) we should
        -- close the webview!
        if data.result == "true" or data.result == "1" then
            webview.destroy(webview_id)
        end

    elseif type == webview.CALLBACK_RESULT_URL_OK then
        -- ...
```

Now we know if a form button was pressed from inside the webview and the player is able to get back
to the game!
