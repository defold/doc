Authenticated access is required for Nintendo Switch builds and when running your own build server instance with authentication enabled ([refer to the build server documentation](https://github.com/defold/extender/blob/dev/README_SECURITY.md) for more information). The username and password can also be set as the system environment variables `DM_EXTENDER_USERNAME` and `DM_EXTENDER_PASSWORD`.
