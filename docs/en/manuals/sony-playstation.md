# Development for PlayStation®4 console 
Due to licensing restrictions, access to Defold versions with support for game development on PS4™ is not included in the standard version of Defold. In order to get access to versions of Defold with PS4™ game development support you need to be registered as a licensed PS4™ game developer.

::: sidenote
Defold currently only provides support for the PS4™ console. Games made for PlayStation®4 will also run on PlayStation®5 in compatibility mode. Official PS5 console support will be available later.
