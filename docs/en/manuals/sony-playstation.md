# Game development for PlayStation®4 and PlayStation®5 consoles 
Due to licensing restrictions, access to Defold versions with support for development on PS4 and PS5 is not included in the standard version of Defold. In order to get access to versions of Defold with PS4 and PS5 game development support you need to be registered as a licensed PS4 and PS5 game developer respectively.

## Registering as developer for PS4 and PS5 game development
You can register as a game developer for PS4™ amnd PS5™ game development from the [PlayStation™ Partners page](https://register.playstation.net/partnership)

When you have been approved by Sony you will get access to the Playstation 5 DevNet and/or Playstation 4 DevNet. Navigate to Development > Tools & Middleware > Tools & Middleware directory > Defold. Click the ‘Confirm Status’ button.
