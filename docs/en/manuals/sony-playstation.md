# Sony PlayStation development

The Defold Foundation is an approved PlayStation® Middleware provider and we are actively working on a Sony PlayStation® port of Defold. We expect this work to be completed by the end of Q4 2022.

Due to Sony licensing restrictions access to Defold versions with support for the Sony PlayStation® platform is not included in the standard version of Defold. In order to get access to versions of Defold with Sony PlayStation® support you need to become an approved game developer for Sony PlayStation®.


## Registering as a Sony Playstation developer

You can register as a game developer for Sony Playstation at the [Sony PlayStation® Partner page](https://register.playstation.net/):

When you have been approved by Sony you will get access to the Tools and Middleware page of the Sony PlayStation® Developer Portal where you can sign up for Defold access. When you register for Defold access we will get an email from Sony verifying you as a registered Sony PlayStation® developer.
