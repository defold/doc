# Bob the builder

Bob is a command line tool for building Defold projects outside of the normal editor workflow.

Bob is able to build data (corresponding to the build step of selecting the editor menu item <kbd>Project ▸ Build And Launch</kbd>), create data archives and create standalone, distributable application bundles (corresponding to the editor menu item <kbd>Project ▸ Bundle ▸ ...</kbd> options)

Bob is distributed as a Java _JAR_ archive containing everything needed to build. You find the latest *bob.jar* distribution at http://d.defold.com. Select a release, then download *bob/bob.jar*. To run the Bob tool, you need [OpenJDK 11 installed on your computer](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/11/).

## Usage

Bob is run from a shell or from the command line by invoking `java` (or `java.exe` on Windows) and providing the bob java archive as argument:

```

Available commands:

`clean`
: Delete built files in the build directory.

`distclean`
: Delete all files in the build directory.

`build`
: Builds all project data. Add the `--archive` option to build a data archive file ("game.darc" in the build directory).

`bundle`
: Creates a platform specific application bundle. Bundling requires that a built archive is present (`build` with the `--archive` option) and that a target platform is specified (with the `--platform` option). Bob creates the bundle in the output directory unless a different directory is specified with the `--bundle-output` option. The bundle is named according to the project name setting in *game.project*. The `--variant` specifies which type of executable to build when bundling and it together with the `--strip-executable` option replaces the `--debug` option. If no `--variant` is specified you will get a release version of the engine (stripped of symbols on Android and iOS). Setting `--variant` to debug and omitting `--strip-executable` yields the same type of executable as `--debug` used to do.

`resolve`
: Resolve all external library dependencies.

Available platforms:

`x86_64-darwin`
: Mac OSX 64 bit

`x86_64-win32`
: Windows 64 bit

`x86-win32`
: Windows 32 bit

`x86_64-linux`
: Linux 64 bit

`arm64-darwin`
: iOS 64 bit

`armv7-darwin`
: iOS 32 bit

`x86_64-ios`
: iOS Mac OSX 64 bit (iOS Simulator)

`armv7-android`
: Android 32 bit

`js-web`
: HTML5

By default, Bob looks in the current directory for a project to build. If you change the current dir to a Defold project and invoke bob, it builds the data for the project in the default output directory *build/default*.

```sh
$ cd /Applications/Defold-beta/branches/14/4/main
$ java -jar bob.jar
100%
$
```

You can string commands together to perform a sequence of tasks in one go. The following example resolves libraries, wipes the build directory, builds archive data and bundles an OSX application (named *My Game.app*):

```sh
$ java -jar bob.jar --archive --platform x86-darwin resolve distclean build bundle
100%
$ ls -al build/default/
total 70784
