# Debugging

Defold contains an integrated Lua debugger with an inspection facility. Together with the built-in [profiling tools](/manuals/profiling) it is a powerful tool that can help finding the cause of bugs in your game logic or help analyze performance issues. Defold also provides crash logs for the rare occasions when the engine itself crashes.
