title: Showing 2D images
brief: This manual describes how to show 2D images and animations using the sprite component.

# Sprites

A Sprite component is a simple image or flipbook animation that is displayed on screen.

![sprite](images/graphics/sprite.png){srcset="images/graphics/sprite@2x.png 2x"}

The Sprite component can use either an [Atlas](/manuals/atlas) or a [Tile Source](/manuals/tilesource) for it's graphics.

## Sprite properties

Apart from the properties *Id*, *Position* and *Rotation* the following component specific properties exist:

*Image*
: If the shader has a single sampler, this field is named `Image`. Otherwise, each slot is named after the texture sampler in the material.
Each slot specifies the atlas or tilesource resource to use for the sprite on that texture sampler.

*DefaultAnimation*
: The animation to use for the sprite. The animation information is taken from the first atlas or tilesource.

*Material*
: The material to use for rendering the sprite.

*Blend Mode*
: The blend mode to use when rendering the sprite.

*Size Mode*
: If set to `Automatic` the editor will set a size of the sprite. If set to `Manual` you can set the size yourself.

*Slice 9*
: Set to preserve the pixel size of the sprite's texture around the edges when the sprite is resized.

## Runtime manipulation

You can manipulate sprites in runtime through a number of different functions and properties (refer to the [API docs for usage](/ref/sprite/)). Functions:

* `sprite.play_flipbook()` - Play an animation on a sprite component.
* `sprite.set_hflip()` and `sprite.set_vflip()` - Set horizontal and vertical flipping on a sprite's animation.

A sprite also has a number of different properties that can be manipulated using `go.get()` and `go.set()`:

`cursor`
: The normalized animation cursor (`number`).

`image`
: The sprite image (`hash`). You can change this using an atlas or tile source resource property and `go.set()`. Refer to the [API reference for an example](/ref/sprite/#image).

`material`
: The sprite material (`hash`). You can change this using a material resource property and `go.set()`. Refer to the [API reference for an example](/ref/sprite/#material).

`playback_rate`
: The animation playback rate (`number`).

`scale`
: The non-uniform scale of the sprite (`vector3`).

`size`
: The size of the sprite (`vector3`). Can only be changed if sprite size-mode is set to manual.

## Material constants

{% include shared/material-constants.md component='sprite' variable='tint' %}

`tint`
: The color tint of the sprite (`vector4`). The vector4 is used to represent the tint with x, y, z, and w corresponding to the red, green, blue and alpha tint.

## Material attributes

A sprite can override vertex attributes from the currently assigned material and will be passed into the vertex shader from the component (refer to the [Material manual for more details](/manuals/material/#attributes)).

The attributes specified in the material will show up as regular properties in the inspector and can be set on individual sprite components. If any of the attributes are overridden, it will show up as an overridden property and stored in the sprite file on disk:

![sprite-attributes](../images/graphics/sprite-attributes.png)

::: sidenote
Custom attributes are available starting from Defold 1.4.8!

## Project configuration

The *game.project* file has a few [project settings](/manuals/project-settings#sprite) related to sprites.

## Multi textured sprites

When a sprite uses multiple textures there are some things to note.

### Animations

The animation data (fps, frame names) is currently taken from the first texture. We'll call this the "driving animation".

The image id's of the driving animation are used to lookup the images in another texture.
So it's important to make sure the frame ids match between textures.

E.g. if your `diffuse.atlas` has a `run` animation like so:

```
run:
    /main/images/hero_run_color_1.png
    /main/images/hero_run_color_2.png
    ...
```

Then the frame id's would be `run/hero_run_color_1` which is not likely to be found in for instance a `normal.atlas`:

```
run:
    /main/images/hero_run_normal_1.png
    /main/images/hero_run_normal_2.png
    ...
```

So we use the `Rename patterns` in the [atlas](/manuals/material/) to rename them.
Set `_color=` and `_normal=` in the corresponding atlases, and you'll get frame names like this in both atlases:

```
run/hero_run_1
run/hero_run_2
...
```

### UVs

The UVs are taken from the first texture. Since there is only one set of vertices, we cannot guarantee
a good match anyways if the secondary textures have either more UV coordinates or a different shape.

This is important to note, so make sure the images have similar enough shapes, or you might experience texture bleeding.

The dimensions of the images in each texture may be different.
