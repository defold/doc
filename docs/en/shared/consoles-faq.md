#### Q: Why is console source code access not free?

A: One of the objectives of the Defold Foundation is to make sure that the Defold software is available to developers world-wide and that the source code is available free of charge. The Defold Foundation will never compromise on this objective, but in this case access to the Sony PlayStation and Nintendo Switch SDK, tools and resources is strictly controlled by Sony and Nintendo. This means that the source code for the console platform implementations in Defold, including the editor and command line tools, can not be made available. This also means that the Defold Foundation is unable to receive community contributions to the code and documentation and it is the foundation which must provide all of the support and updates to the platform for as long as it is required to. The console source code access fee will help ensure that the foundation has the resources necessary to support the platform.


#### Q: Do I need to install additional tools to build for consoles?

A: You will be able to create application bundles from the command line tools. Information about how to test on Sony PlayStation and Nintendo Switch hardware will be provided to you when you are given access to the respective platforms.


#### Q: Is it still easy to use a single code base if I decide to also target consoles?

A: Yes, all of the standard Defold API functions are available also for the console platforms. In addition to the standard functionality you will also have access to a couple of Sony PlayStation and Nintendo Switch specific functions, but in general the code should be able to remain exactly the same across multiple platforms.
