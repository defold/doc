#### Q: Why is Nintendo Switch access not free?

A: One of the objectives of the Defold Foundation is to make sure that the Defold software is available to developers world-wide and that the source code is available free of charge. The Defold Foundation will never compromise on this objective, but in this case access to the Nintendo Switch SDK, tools and resources is strictly controlled by Nintendo. This means that the source code for the Nintendo Switch platform implementation in Defold, including the editor and command line tools, can not be made available. This also means that the Defold Foundation is unable to receive community contributions to the code and documentation and it is the foundation which must provide all of the support and updates to the platform for as long as it is required to. The Nintendo Switch access fee will help ensure that the foundation has the resources necessary to support the platform.


#### Q: Do I need to install additional tools to build for Nintendo Switch?

A: You will be able to create application bundles directly from both the Defold editor and command line tools. Information about how to test on Nintendo Switch hardware will be provided to you when you are given access to the Nintendo Switch platform.


#### Q: Is it still easy to use a single code base if I decide to also target the Nintendo Switch platform?

A: Yes, all of the standard Defold API functions are available also for the Nintendo Switch platform. In addition to the standard functionality you will also have access to a couple of Nintendo Switch specific functions, but in general the code should be able to remain exactly the same across multiple platforms.
