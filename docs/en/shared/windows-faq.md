#### Q: Why are GUI box nodes without a texture transparent in the editor but show up as expected when I build and run?

A: This error can happen on [computers using AMD Radeon GPUs](https://github.com/defold/editor2-issues/issues/2723). Make sure to update your graphics drivers.

#### Q: Why am I getting 'com.sun.jna.Native.open.class java.lang.Error: Access is denied' when opening an atlas or a scene view?

A: Try running Defold as administrator. Right-click on the Defold executable and select "Run as Administrator".

#### Q: Why is my game not rendering properly on Windows using an Intel UHD integrated GPU (but my HTML5 build works)?

A: Make sure to update your driver to a version higher than or equal to 27.20.100.8280. Check with the [Intel Driver Support Assistant](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/search.html?ws=text#t=Downloads&layout=table&cf:Downloads=%5B%7B%22actualLabel%22%3A%22Graphics%22%2C%22displayLabel%22%3A%22Graphics%22%7D%2C%7B%22actualLabel%22%3A%22Intel%C2%AE%20UHD%20Graphics%20Family%22%2C%22displayLabel%22%3A%22Intel%C2%AE%20UHD%20Graphics%20Family%22%7D%2C%7B%22actualLabel%22%3A%22Intel%C2%AE%20UHD%20Graphics%20630%22%2C%22displayLabel%22%3A%22Intel%C2%AE%20UHD%20Graphics%20630%22%7D%5D).

#### Q: The Defold editor is crashing and the log shows AWTError: Assistive Technology not found

If the editor crashes with a log mentioning `Caused by: java.awt.AWTError: Assistive Technology not found: com.sun.java.accessibility.AccessBridge` then follow these steps:

* Navigate to `C:\Users\<username>`
* Open the file called `.accessibility.properties` using a standard text editor (Notepad is fine)
* Find the following lines in the config:

```
assistive_technologies=com.sun.java.accessibility.AccessBridge
screen_magnifier_present=true
```

* Add a hashmark (`#``) in front of theses lines
* Save your changes to the file and restart Defold
