#### Q: Why are GUI box nodes without a texture transparent in the editor but show up as expected when I build and run?

A: This error can happen on [computers using AMD Radeon GPUs](https://github.com/defold/editor2-issues/issues/2723). Make sure to update your graphics drivers.

#### Q: Why am I getting 'com.sun.jna.Native.open.class java.lang.Error: Access is denied' when opening an atlas or a scene view?

A: Try running Defold as administrator. Right-click on the Defold executable and select "Run as Administrator".
