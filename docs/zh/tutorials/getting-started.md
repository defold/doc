# Getting started

The Defold engine and editor are powerful tools with a lot of features and functionality to learn. To help you on your way we have created a variety of tutorials. Many of the tutorials are available directly from within the editor which makes them very easy to get started with.

## Starting a tutorial from the editor

When you run the Defold editor, you are presented with a project selection and creation screen. From here you can easily select which tutorial you want to try out:

1. Start Defold.
2. Select *New Project* on the left.
3. Select the *From Tutorial* tab.
4. Select a tutorial that you are interested in.
5. Select a location for the project on your local drive.
6. Click *Create New Project*.

![create project](images/getting-started/new-project.png){srcset="images/getting-started/new-project@2x.png 2x"}

The editor now automatically downloads the tutorial project, opens it in the editor and opens the tutorial text (the "README" file in the project root).

Now follow the tutorial text! If you want to get back to the text, <kbd>double click</kbd> the "README" file in the *Assets* view. You can also <kbd>right click</kbd> the tab of open files and select <kbd>Move to Other Tab Pane</kbd> to view the tutorial text side by side with the file you are working on.
