# Resources and spawning

This manual explains Defold's dynamic spawning features and how to use them.

Defold has two components that are used to dynamically spawn game objects into a running game. They allow you to create things like bullets that appear when the player fires a weapon, effects that spawn at certain triggers or, perhaps, pickups that are dropped when an enemy is defeated.
