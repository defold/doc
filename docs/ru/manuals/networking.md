# Networking

It is not uncommon for games to have some kind of connection to a backend service, perhaps to post scores, handle match making or store saved games in the cloud. Many games also have peer to peer connections where game clients communicate directly with each other, without involvement of a central server. Network connections and the exchange of data can be made using several different protocols and standards. Learn more about the different ways to use network connections in Defold:
