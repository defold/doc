# Getting help

If you run into a problem while using Defold we'd like to hear from you so that we can fix the issue and/or help you work around the problem! There are several ways to discuss and also report issues. Chose the option that works best for you:

## Report a problem on the forum

A good way to discuss and get help with a problem is to post a question on our [forum](https://forum.defold.com). Post either in the [Questions](https://forum.defold.com/c/questions) or [Bugs](https://forum.defold.com/c/bugs) category depending on the type of problem you have. Remember to [search](https://forum.defold.com/search) for your question/issue before asking as there may already be a solution to your problem.

If you have several questions, create multiple posts. Do not ask unrelated questions in the same post.

### Required information
We will not be able to provide support unless you provide the information needed:

**Title**
Make sure to use a short and descriptive title. A good title would be "How do I move a game object in the direction it is rotated?" or "How do I fade out a sprite?". A bad title would be "I need some help using Defold!" or "My game is not working!".

**Describe the bug (REQUIRED)**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce (REQUIRED)**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error

**Expected behavior (REQUIRED)**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Defold version (REQUIRED):**
  - Version [e.g. 1.2.155]

**Platforms (REQUIRED):**
 - Platforms: [e.g. iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, Linux, HTML5]
 - OS: [e.g. iOS8.1, Windows 10, High Sierra]
 - Device: [e.g. iPhone6]

**Minimal repro case project (OPTIONAL):**
Please attach a minimal project where the bug is reproduced. This will greatly help the person trying to investigate and fix the bug.

**Logs (OPTIONAL):**
Please provide relevant logs from engine, editor or build server. Learn where the logs are stored [here](#log-files).

**Workaround (OPTIONAL):**
If there is a workaround, please describe it here.

**Screenshots (OPTIONAL):**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**Additional context (OPTIONAL):**
Add any other context about the problem here.


### Sharing code
When you share code it is recommended to share the code as text, not as screenshots. Sharing it as text makes it easy to search, to highlight errors and to suggest and make modifications. Share code by wrapping it in three \`\`\` or indenting it with 4 spaces.

Example:

\`\`\`
print("Hello code!")
\`\`\`

Result:

```
print("Hello code!")
```


## Report a problem from the editor

The editor provides a convenient way to report issues. Select the <kbd>Help->Report Issue</kbd> menu option from within the editor to report an issue.

Selecting this menu option will bring you to an issue tracker on GitHub. Provide [log files](#log-files), information about your operating system, steps to reproduce the problem, possible workarounds etc.

::: sidenote
You need a GitHub account to submit a bug report this way.

## Discuss a problem on Discord

If you run into a problem while using Defold you can try to ask the question on [Discord](https://www.defold.com/discord/). We do however recommend that complex questions and in-depth discussions are posted on the forum. Also note that we do not accept bug reports submitted through Discord.


# Log files

The engine, editor and build server generates logging information that can be very valuable when asking for help and debugging an issue. Always provide log files when reporting a problem:

* [Engine logs](/manuals/debugging-game-and-system-logs)
* [Editor logs](/manuals/editor#editor-logs)
* [Build server logs](/manuals/extensions#build-server-logs)
