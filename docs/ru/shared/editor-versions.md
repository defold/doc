## Editor 1 and 2

We are currently transitioning to Defold editor 2, which right now is in beta. Most new documentation we produce is for the new editor and we will eventually update all documentation, but that process will take time. You can recognize the editor version in screenshots from the color theme.

Editor 2 features a nice, dark theme:

Editor 1 has a standard light theme:
