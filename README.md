# Defold manuals

This repo holds the markdown source files and assets for Defold documentation. The files are processed by the Defold site project at https://www.github.com/defold/defold.github.io.

The www.defold.com site is automatically rebuilt via a `repository_dispatch` event generated from [this workflow](https://github.com/defold/doc/blob/master/.github/workflows/trigger-site-rebuild.yml) when changes are pushed to the this repository.
